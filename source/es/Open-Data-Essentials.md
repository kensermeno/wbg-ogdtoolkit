This section of the toolkit provides a summary of the essential elements
of open government data, starting with its definition and covering
issues from open data portals, applications that use open data, the
benefits of open data, open data policy declarations, learning resources
and technical assistance resources for open data. The toolkit provides
links to many examples of these.

What is Open Data?
------------------

Data is open if it satisfies both conditions below:

**Technically open:** available in a machine-readable standard format,
which means it can be retrieved and meaningfully processed by a computer
application

**Legally open:** explicitly licensed in a way that permits commercial
and non-commercial use and re-use without restrictions. Below you can
find some examples of terms of use in data licensing:
