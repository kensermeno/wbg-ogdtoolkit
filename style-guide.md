## Grammar & Punctuation ##


### Abbreviations and Acronyms


For countries, use abbreviations, with periods:


>U.S., U.K.


Spell out acronyms at first occurrence, followed by the acronym is
  parentheses; use acronym in all subsequent references:


>Ministry, Department or Agency (MDA)


For acronym plurals, use a lowercase "s," without an apostrophe


>NGOs



### Capitals and Lowercase


Capitalize the following words and terms:

>Open Data  
>Toolkit (when referencing OGD Toolkit)


The following words and terms are lowercase:

>open source  
>website



### Commas, Periods and Colons


In a series of three or more, do not use serial commas (unless the
series is comprised of very long, complex statements, when serial
commas or semicolons may be used to separate ideas):


>Data must be updated, public and accessible.


Insert periods or commas inside quotes:


>The SME added a section called "Key Research."
>
>Data, many of which are "open," are available through this resource.


Colons should appear outside quotes:


>The following is a definition of "data literacy"\:


### Hyphens and Dashes


Hyphenate the following words and terms:


>Crowd-mapping  
>Crowd-sourcing  
>Decision-makers  
>Inter-agency  
>Non-profit  
>Non-proprietary  
>Re-development  
>Re-structure  
>Re-use  
>Re-usable


Hyphenate unit modifiers:

>Cloud-based computing


Do not hyphenate modifiers ending in "ly"\:

>Publicly accessible servers


Em-dashes are used for emphasis or parenthetically, and are inserted
without any spaces on either side. In the Toolkit, em-dashes are
represented by three consecutive hyphens:


>The Toolkit\-\-\-and its associated updates\-\-\-is comprised of six sections.


## Formatting ##


The Toolkit uses the Kramdown text processor, which provides conventions
and simple substitutes for most common HTML tags and formats. For format
guidance, refer first to this document, and supplement this information
with the Kramdown [quick reference](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) and [complete syntax](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) guides.



### Bullets


Bulleted lists highlight or summarize key information so readers can
identify these points quickly. Numbered lists are used when steps or
instructions are presented in sequence, or when the text suggests a
hierarchy.


Kramdown provides [shortcuts](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#lists) for both numbered and bulleted lists.
Bulleted list items start with an asterisk (\*) or plus sign (+),
followed by a space character.


Use an initial cap after a bullet.

>* The program provides mobile strategy consulting.


For bullets that start with titles or topics, boldface the title,
insert a period after the title and initial cap the first word after
the period. If text following a bullet is a phrase, do not insert any
punctuation at the end, unless the phrase is followed by a full
sentence; in this case, both the phrase and full sentence end with
periods.


>* **Searching.** Full-text search and faceted search. This tool also
>  provides filtering and sorting of results.
>
>* **Searching.** Full-text search and faceted search



### Emphasis


To emphasize a word or term, use boldface; avoid using italics and all
caps.




## Usage & Style ##



### One word versus two


The following are written as one word:

>Datasets  
>Interoperability  
>Login  
>Nonpartisan  
>Policymakers  
>Redesign  
>Subnational  
>Subset  
>Website  
>Worldwide


### Numerals and Dates

Spell out numbers zero through nine; use numerals for 10 and
  greater:Â 


>$3 million  
>three countries


Use a lowercase "s" to denote date ranges:

>During the 2000s


### Plurals


"Data" are plural.



### Symbols


Use % symbol, not "percent" or "per cent."



### Voice


Use active voice.


>*Active voice example:*
>
>This program enhances Open Data options for citizen use.
>
>*Passive voice example:*
>
>Open Data options can be enhanced for citizen use with this program.



## Writing Guidelines ##


Because many users scan documents and web pages and do not read them in
depth, it's important to write concisely, format text so that it is easy
to scan and organize text so readers can locate topics quickly.


In general, all writing should be:


* **Clear.** Use simple, straightforward language and define technical
  terms.

* **Concise.** Convey information as briefly as possible, avoid
  repetition of words and ideas and eliminate unneeded words (e.g., "to"
  rather than "in order to").

* **Accurate.** Ensure information is correct, objective and current.

* **Visually appealing.** Use topic heads, subheads, bullets, numbered
  lists, short paragraphs, "more" widgets, hyperlinks and other
  techniques to increase white space and make information easier to
  read. Write heads and subheads that are short and meaningful and
  accurately represent the key ideas in the text.

* **Consistent.** When writing new text or adding text to existing
  content, use previously approved documentation, if available, as a
  guideline. Ensure voice, tone, style, language and formatting are
  consistent with the rest of the document and comply with approved
  organizational style standards (note that an intranet link is not
  available outside the Bank's firewall).

* **Relevant.** Ensure that information is appropriate for its targeted
  audience.


When writing for the OGD Toolkit, use these specific guidelines:

* **Summarize links.** When providing a link to additional information,
  include a short summary of the link's content, the source or author of
  the content and the content's date. Readers can then determine without
  having to click on the link whether this information is relevant to
  them. If several such links appear in succession, consider using a
  bulleted list.

* **Begin each section with a short summary of key points.** First,
  define a section's or subsection's key messages and objectives, then
  write a one- or two-sentence overview that condenses this information.
  The statements that follow should progress logically from these
  opening sentences.

* **Simplify.** Use short sentences, comprised of only one idea
  wherever possible, especially if the discussion is complex or
  technical. Avoid run-on sentences.

* **Use hyperlinks for secondary information.** Hyperlinks make reading
  more efficient by providing the option to access more or related
  information about a topic rather than including that information in
  the text. Use hyperlinks for information that is not critical to the
  understanding of a concept.

* **Use relative hyperlinks for pages within the toolkit.** When linking
  to other pages or sections in the toolkit, use relative links, like this:

  >\[open data essentials\](essentials.html)

  and not absolute links like this;

  >\[open data essentials\](http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/essentials.html)

  Doing so will keep your content portable (in case the server name changes), and
  will facilitate translated pages. You can also link to major sections within a
  page like this:

  >\[examples of open data\](essentials.html#examples)

  Or if the section is on the current page:

  >\[examples of open data\](#examples)

* **Use "more" widgets to shorten text blocks.** When long descriptions
  or explanations are needed to enhance understanding of a topic, but
  the entire description is not necessary for immediate understanding,
  consider using the "more" widget. This feature shortens a text block
  by hiding several sentences and replacing them with a link called
  "more," which provides readers with the option of revealing the full
  text description. This is especially helpful in lists where several
  items have descriptions of three or more sentences. To use the "more"
  widget:


  * Enclose the text to be hidden in HTML `<cite>` tags:

	>This group advocates for economics to be built on transparent
	>foundations. `<cite>`It interprets economic research on Open Data
	>and identifies best practices and legal, regulatory and technical
	>standards for open economic data. Its blog features positive effects
	>that opening data has had in economics and shows how economists can
	>mainstream the openness concept.`</cite>`

  * The opening and closing `<cite>` tags must be in the same
	paragraph.  

  * The sentence(s) preceding the `<cite>` tag (i.e., the sentence
	that will always be visible) must be concise but sufficiently
	informative.

* **Outline complex ideas first.** To convey a complex idea, identify
  its major points or components, list them, arrange them logically and
  write from that outline.

* **Be conservative with emphasis and punctuation.** Use boldface
  sparingly and for only the most important terms. Don't overuse
  punctuation, such as commas, dashes, quotes or parentheses, as these
  can interrupt reading flow and comprehension.
