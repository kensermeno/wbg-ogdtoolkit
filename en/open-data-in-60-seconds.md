title: Open Data in 60 Seconds
---

If you've ever used the GPS system in your smartphone, checked an online weather forecast, researched a safety recall on
your vehicle or calculated how much your city paid for road repairs, you’ve used Open Data. For a long time, however,
accessing these government data were very difficult, if they were available at all.

The concept of Open Data is very new. It originated with the belief that the enormous amount of information routinely collected by
government entities should be available to all citizens. In the late 2000s, governments and entities
began to allow a greater number of users access to these resources. Today, more than 250 governments at national,
subnational and city levels; almost 50 developed and developing countries; and entities such as the World Bank and
United Nations have launched Open Data initiatives—and more are launched every year.

Data are considered to be "open" if anyone can freely use, reuse and redistribute them, for any purpose, without
restrictions. While lots of data are published on government websites, the majority of published data are intended to
only be read, not re-used in other purposes. To be considered "open," the data must be re-usable, meaning they can be
downloaded in open formats and read by software.

When data are made widely available and easy to use, the benefits can
be significant: they  can help streamline government services, stimulate economic opportunities, encourage innovation,
improve public safety and reduce poverty.
As the benefits of Open Data impact broader populations and additional useful options are discovered, governments and
institutions worldwide are eager to launch new or expand existing Open Data programs. It will take time to fully
understand the complexity and broad potential of Open Data, which is derived from the “open” environment of licensing
As Open Data is still in its early stages, best practices and communities are just beginning to emerge.

## About This Toolkit

This Open Government Data Toolkit is a collection of online tools and knowledge, to support
the Open Data development efforts in client countries and in the growing number of other entities and organizations that
are joining this technical revolution. The Toolkit provides guidance they need to create their own Open Data strategies
and platforms. Open Data initiatives can be thought of as economies, in which data are the commodity, data users
(or consumers) provide demand for data, and government agencies and other sources provide the supply of data. This
toolkit incorporates this approach into thinking about how to structure an Open Data initiative.


The Toolkit is comprised of this introduction and seven sections:

1. [Open Data Essentials](essentials.html). *Revise* How to get started; overview of applications, policies, benefits and challenges; technical assistance; FAQs; useful for all

2. [Starting an Open Data Initiative](starting.html). *Revise*

3. [Technology Options](technology.html). Summarizes key technical issues in Open Data catalog development; especially helpful to IT specialists

4. [Demand & Engagement](demand.html). How to build communities of data users and promote Open Data literacy in local,
national and regional stakeholders; how to advance Open Data concepts through partnerships, media and others; of
particular interest to government agencies, civil society organizations, technologists and journalists

5. [Supply & Quality of Data](supply.html). How to manage datasets; locate data; ensure data quality, timeliness and accuracy; especially helpful for data producers

6. [Readiness Assessment Tool](odra.html). How to use the World Bank's methodological tool to diagnose the actions that a
government needs to take to launch an Open Data initiative. This section is of particular interest to governments that
are committed to Open Data but don't know where to start.

7. [Technical Assistance and Funding](technical-assistance.html). *Revise*
