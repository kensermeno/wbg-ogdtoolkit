title: Open Data in a Nutshell
---

If you've ever gone online to check the weather, research a safety recall on your vehicle or calculate how much your
city paid for road repairs, you've used Open Data. For a long time, however, accessing the government data you’d need to
find this information was very difficult, if it was available at all.

The concept of Open Data originated with the belief that the enormous amount of information routinely collected by
government entities should be available to all citizens. In the late 2000s, governments and international organizations
began to allow a greater number of users access to these resources. Today, more than 250 governments at national,
subnational and city levels; almost 50 developed and developing countries; and entities such as the World Bank and
United Nations have launched Open Data initiatives—and more are launched every year.

Data are considered to be “open” if anyone can freely use, reuse and redistribute them, for any purpose, without
restrictions. When data are made widely available and easy to use, the benefits can be significant: they can help
streamline government services, stimulate economic opportunities, encourage innovation, improve public safety and reduce
poverty. Open Data initiatives are helping to build modern, citizen-centered public sectors and vibrant Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) markets.

For data to be truly open, however, they must also be:

* **Technically open**, with no technology barriers to its use. They must be published in electronic machine-readable
formats and cataloged so they’re easy to find and download.

* **Legally open**, so anyone can use and share them. This requires liberal terms of use or licensing agreements, or placing
data in the public domain. Here are [examples of license agreements](essentials.html#licenses).

Examples of data that are often opened include:

* **National/ministerial budget and expenditure data**, which empower citizens to monitor public spending
Educational data, which parents use to make informed choices about schools and curriculums
* **Draft legislation**, which details the lawmaking process and how representatives voted
* **Health and disease statistics**, which aid medical breakthroughs and alert researchers and consumers to issues such as epidemics and drug side effects
* **Labor statistics and employment data**, which reveal local occupational trends in economic growth and hiring
* **Weather and disaster risk data**
* **Environmental data**, which residents use to document the incidence and sources of air and water pollution in their towns

As the benefits of Open Data impact broader populations and additional useful options are discovered, governments and
institutions worldwide are eager to launch new or expand existing Open Data programs. It will take time to fully
understand the complexity and broad potential of Open Data, which is derived from the “open” environment of licensing
and copyright protection common to the Open Source concept. Open Data is still in its early stages, however, and best
practices and communities are just beginning to emerge.

### About This Toolkit ###

Countries such as the U.S. and U.K., as well as the World Bank, introduced the first Open Data platforms in 2009. Since
that time, the World Bank has leveraged its experience with some of the world's pioneering Open Data initiatives to
become a leader in providing Open Data solutions and tools. Its Open Data platform includes information about the
thousands of projects compiled in its World Development Indicators. This substantial body of information is available at
no charge when users attribute data used to the World Bank. 

The World Bank also produced this Open Government Data Toolkit, a collection of online tools and knowledge, to support
the Open Data development efforts in client countries and in the growing number of other entities and organizations that
are joining this technical revolution. The Toolkit provides guidance they need to create their own Open Data strategies
and platforms.  

The Toolkit is comprised of six sections:

* **Open Data in a Nutshell** (this page). Introduction to the open data concept, relevance, history and World Bank platform; especially helpful for beginners 

* [Open Data Essentials](essentials.html). How to get started; overview of applications, policies, benefits and challenges; technical assistance; FAQs; useful for all

* [Technology Options for Open Data Systems](technology.html). Summarizes key technical issues in Open Data catalog development; especially helpful to IT specialists

* [Demand & Engagement](demand.html). How to build communities of data users and promote Open Data literacy in local, national and regional stakeholders; how to advance Open Data concepts through partnerships, media and others; of particular interest to government agencies, civil society organizations, technologists and journalists

* [Supply & Quality of Data](supply.html). How to manage datasets; locate data; ensure data quality, timeliness and accuracy; especially helpful for data producers

* [Readiness Assessment Tool](odra.html). How to use the World Bank’s methodological tool to assess a government’s readiness to design and implement Open Data initiatives; of particular interest to governments just starting to explore Open Data
