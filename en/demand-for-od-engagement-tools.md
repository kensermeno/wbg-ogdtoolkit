title: Demand and Engagement
locale: en

Central and local governments around the world are increasingly
‘opening' a range of data, for free, including as part of continuing
global efforts to strengthen ‘open government.’ While this has resulted
in excitement from development practitioners, government sponsors, and
technologists, much of the public has been left behind. As a result, the
level of informed public debate across regions on data-driven issues -
from budgets to service delivery to the practical effectiveness of donor
aid – in 'opened’ sectors is low.

So, now that this data has been ‘opened’, how can it capture the
attention and imaginations of the full spectrum of users? How can we
focus on the other side - the demand side - of the open data phenomenon?
How can we grow communities of data users, and encourage data
'ownership' by the media, civic hackers, community groups, NGOs, labor
unions, professional associations, universities, and more?

To help developing countries address the demand-side of open data, the
World Bank offers a ‘menu’ of services to promote and support 'Open Data
Literacy', the goal of which is to catalyze, engage, and inspire
strategic multi-stakeholder groups to see the value and potential of
open data, and what it means for local, national, and regional
development in a practical, hands-on way.

STEP 1: Early Engagement
------------------------

**Catalyzing Supply/Demand Side Actors to Support Opened Data; Surfacing
Data**

-   **‘Open Data Sensitization’ Roundtable –** an overview of open data
    processes crystallized from World Bank and partner experiences.
    Examples include sessions at the first and second [International
    Open Government Data
    Conferences](http://www.data.gov/communities/conference), [Open
    Government Conference in
    Moscow](http://xn--e1aajfpcds8ay4h.xn--80abeamcuufxbhgound0h9cl.xn--p1ai/en/),
    and at the [Regional Conference on Open Data for Latin America and
    the Caribbean](http://confdatosabiertos.uy/home).

-   **The ‘Business Case for Open Data’ Roundtable –** a high-level
    roundtable to encourage use, analysis, and ownership of Open Data,
    and to catalyze leadership on both supply/demand sides. This
    information resonate with particular audiences and twinned with
    support opportunities from the Bank and close partners, including
    the ‘Data Literacy Bootcamp’ detailed below. Examples include [Media
    Leaders Roundtables on ‘Open Data and the Future of
    News’](http://allafrica.com/stories/201201300873.html) in Ghana,
    Kenya, Nepal, Tanzania, and South Africa.

-   **Data Liberation Scrape-a-thon –** an ‘early engagement’ 2-day
    program which convenes international coders (and sources local civic
    coders) to scrape as much existing (unstructured) government data
    off current websites, structuring it (CSV format); and using it
    populate a nascent or temporary open data platform. The goal is to
    start to gain traction on early open data process by capitalizing on
    what's already available, and leveraging it to build momentum toward
    further opening by individual ministries. Examples include support
    for the [Hacks/Hackers Open News Scrape-a-thon in
    Chile](http://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersChile/photos/all_photos/?photoAlbumId=15810502),
    where ‘scraped’ data is hosted for free on civically owned and
    communally managed repositories, such as
    [OpenAfricaData.org](http://africaopendata.org/) and
    [OpenDataLatinoAmerica.org](http://www.opendatalatinoamerica.org/home/).

STEP 2: Capacity Development
----------------------------

**Capacity Development on 'Opened' Data Literacy & Aftercare, to Ensure
Continued, Strategic Engagement**

-   **Open Data Literacy Bootcamps –** a 3-day intensive,
    'learning-by-doing' workshop focused on core skills development for
    journalists, civil society, and civic coders. Each participant will
    be assigned a desktop computer in a large classroom for hands-on,
    guided practicals. Sessions include: Demos of Open Data portals;
    Training on Excel/spreadsheet & creating pivot tables; Scraping
    local county / national data from local Open Data portals; Cleaning
    this data; Creating visualizations; Intro to GIS Mapping; and
    ultimately crafting narratives around data, into to building apps,
    and action plans using these skills and the data. Example
    engagements include Data Literacy Bootcamps in
    [Bolivia](http://bolivia.databootcamp.org/), Ghana (National Budget
    Data), [Ghana (Extractive Industries
    Data)](http://ghana.databootcamp.org/),
    [Jordan](http://jordan.databootcamp.org/),
    [Nepal](http://nepal.databootcamp.org/),
    [Malawi](http://malawi.databootcamp.org/),
    [Moldova](http://www.opendta.org/Pages/Events/Moldova-Innovation-Week-2012--Open-Development-Technology-Alliance.aspx),
    [South Africa](https://sites.google.com/site/databootcampsa/),
    [Tanzania](https://sites.google.com/site/databootcamptz/), and
    [Tunisia](https://sites.google.com/site/databootcamptunisia/).

-   **Open Data Master Classes –** a longer (5-day) Bootcamp-style
    training for mid-career demand-side practitioners, which dives even
    deeper into 'Data Literacy’ experiential learning and skills
    building with data analysis.

-   **E-Learning on ‘Open Data Literacy’ –** currently under
    collaborative development, for launch in 2013. This ‘Open Data
    Literacy’ e-learning course will be a weeks-long virtual course
    which demos an even broader array of the above ‘Data Literacy’
    tools. It will be offered as both a facilitated and self-guided
    course, to maximize utility for a broad audience. The courses will
    be free, open source and made available on multiple e-learning
    platforms.

-   **Sustained Aftercare –** above engagements are followed by capacity
    development with the same cohort over months, in collaboration with
    local and regional partners for high impact and cost-effective
    sustainability, and iterative skills building to ensure utility. For
    example, participants are organized into (or invited to join) local
    HacksHackers chapters, to bring together journalists (hacks) with
    technologists (hackers) for monthly meet-ups to collaborate on
    digital experiments to integrate data-driven journalism into the
    news.

STEP 3: Use + Ownership + Reuse
-------------------------------

**Data Use + Ownership + Data Reuse by the Public**

-   **'Utility' Hackathons –** ‘utility hackathons’ are organized around
    particular development challenges, where data has already been
    surfaced (including through ‘data liberation scrape-a-thons’).
    Hackers use existing data to develop and build utility apps to solve
    development problems, with an emphasis on public service delivery.
    Winners receive seed grants to build out and deploy resultant
    ‘utility apps’, and are offered post-hackathon mentoring and advice
    to accelerate development/deployment, and - importantly - seek to
    repurpose the resultant ‘utility apps’ in other country/regions to
    meet analogous needs. Example ‘utility hackathons’ have cut across
    key development areas, such as [domestic
    violence](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/01/22/domestic-violence-hackathon-smartphone-lifesaver),
    [water quality and
    access](http://www.scribd.com/doc/97458967/Water-Hackathon-Lessons-Learned),
    and [sanitation](http://www.sanitationhackathon.org/).

-   **Prototype Funds –** a partnership-driven process to connect
    well-developed ‘utility app’ and data usage projects (i.e.
    post-redesign/re-development stage, through prior mentorship and
    feedback) to ‘Angel List’-type funding to build out and deploy
    scalable models. An example partnership-driven engagement is the
    [\$1 million Africa News Innovation
    Challenge](http://africannewschallenge.org/).

STEP 4: Further Development
---------------------------

**Further ‘Open Data Ecosystem’ Development**

-   **Code for [Your Country].** This is a partnership-driven, 6-month
    ‘Code Fellowship’ program which collaboratively integrates top civic
    coders into government ministries, to deploy coding skills for
    improved public service delivery, and into media and civil society
    organizations to strengthen the creation of data-driven content,
    products, and services for mass public consumption, analysis, and
    use. This initiative also aims to improve transparent, accountable
    governance by supporting the surfacing and opening of demand-driven,
    actionable data and strengthening both data-driven analysis and
    decision-making at all levels. An example partnership-driven
    engagement is [Code4Kenya](http://www.code4kenya.org/).
