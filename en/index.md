title: Open Government Data Toolkit

## Welcome to the Open Government Data Toolkit
{: .notoc :}

The **Open Government Data Toolkit** is designed to help governments, Bank staff and users understand the basic
precepts of Open Data, then get “up to speed” in planning and implementing an open government data program, while
avoiding common pitfalls.  We suggest that you [begin reading here](open-data-in-60-seconds.html).

Getting started with Open Data can be easier than many people think. If you have data in a [re-usable electronic
form](essentials.html#definition), a [publicly accessible online place](technology.html) to put it, and an [open license](essentials.html#licenses),
then you’re well on your way.

We update the OGD Toolkit frequently with new information. If you have suggestions or corrections, please [send us
feedback](http://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org#givefeedback).

## Notes to Reviewers
{: .notoc :}

Thank you for helping to review the Toolkit! Major improvements include:

* Significantly expanded and reorganized content
* Additional sections: "Open Data in 60 Seconds" and "Technical Assistance and Funding"
* Improved navigation
* Mobile support
* Eventual multi-lingual support

Note that some sections are still "under construction;" you'll see highlights and blue links to Github in some places.

We are interested in your feedback on both substance (any information that is missing, incomplete, unclear, etc) and general usability
(navigation, use on mobile devices, broken links, etc).

Please try to send comments by **Friday, December 12th**. Let me know if you need more time.

There are 3 options to send feedback:

1. Via email: <therzog1@worldbank.org>
2. There is a [Google doc][gdoc] with the complete text of the toolkit. See usage notes below
3. If you're comfortable in Github, you can [fork this project](https://github.com/tgherzog/wbg-ogdtoolkit) and send me a pull request. The
   source texts are in the `/en` and `_includes/en` directories.

**Guidelines for the Google Doc**

* Use "Suggesting" mode (right side of the toolbar), which is similar to "track changes" in MS Word
* The Google doc version has minor formatting glitches due to the vagaries of copy/paste. Please refer to the Toolkit version as the
  master source
* The Toolkit employs "more" links in several sections (like [this one](starting.html#benefits)) to initially abbreviate long text blocks until the user reveals them. These are
  missing in the Google version so you can see the entire text.

Thanks!

Tim
