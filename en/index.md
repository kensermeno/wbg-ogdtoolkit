## Welcome to the Open Government Data Toolkit ##

The **Open Government Data Toolkit** is designed to help governments, Bank staff and ordinary users understand the basic precepts of Open Data, then get “up to speed” in planning and implementing an open government data program, while avoiding common pitfalls. The following chart shows the Toolkit’s structure. We suggest that you [start here](#LINK).

Getting started with Open Data can be easier than many people think. If you have data in a [re-usable electronic form](#LINK), a [publicly accessible online place](#LINK) to put it, and an [open license](#LINK), then you’re well on your way.

We update the OGD Toolkit frequently with new information. If you have suggestions or corrections, please [send us feedback](#LINK) or [fork this project on Github](#LINK) .
