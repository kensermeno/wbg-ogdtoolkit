## Welcome to the Open Government Data Toolkit ##

The **Open Government Data Toolkit** is designed to help governments, Bank staff and ordinary users understand the basic
precepts of Open Data, then get “up to speed” in planning and implementing an open government data program, while
avoiding common pitfalls.  We suggest that you [start here](open-data-nutshell.html).

Getting started with Open Data can be easier than many people think. If you have data in a [re-usable electronic
form](essentials.html#definition), a [publicly accessible online place](technology.html) to put it, and an [open license](essentials.html#licenses),
then you’re well on your way.

We update the OGD Toolkit frequently with new information. If you have suggestions or corrections, please [send us
feedback](http://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org#givefeedback) or [fork this project on Github](https://github.com/worldbank/wbg-ogdtoolkit) .
