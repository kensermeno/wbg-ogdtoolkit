title: Starting an Open Data Initiative
---

This section provides some of the tools that governments will need to take the first steps in an
Open Data initiative. It is intended for public sector managers and staff who have been tasked with
coordinating or organizing an Open Data initative.

As planning for an Open Data initiative takes shape and the number of participants expands,
other sections of this toolkit will become relevant to various roles, including
[technology management](technology.html), [user engagement](demand.html), and [data production](supply.html).
In the very early stages of planning, [technical support](technical-support.html) and the [Open Data Readiness
Assessment](odra.html) are also relevant.
