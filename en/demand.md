title: Demand and Engagement
---


Central and local governments around the world are increasingly opening a range of data and making them available for
free, often as part of continuing global efforts to further the reality of open government. While this has resulted in
wide approval from development practitioners, government sponsors and technologists, the general public has not been
widely engaged in the effort. As a result, the level of informed public debate on data-driven issues –- from budgets, to
service delivery, to the practical effectiveness of donor aid –- is low, even in many of the "opened" sectors.

Increasing the level of awareness of Open Data and its potential value is of particular interest to government agencies,
civil society organizations, technologists and journalists. As data is opened, however, capturing the attention and
imagination of the full spectrum of data users and consumers remains a challenge. How do we engage the other side -- the
demand side -- of the Open Data phenomenon? How can we grow communities of data users and encourage data "ownership" by
the media, community groups, NGOs, labor unions, professional associations, universities and others?

Realizing the full benefits of data use also means engaging civic hackers, also known as programmers and developers.
Hackathons produce numerous shared products and apps that improve the quality of life for citizens, and the movement
within the development community to reclaim the term "hackers" to emphasize their positive contributions to civil
society has been gaining wider acceptance by the general public.  

The maturity level of an Open Data initiative and the audience to which that initiative is targeted are primary factors
to consider when assessing which engagement strategies and activities to use. To engage a variety of stakeholders as an
Open Data program develops, the following strategy addresses both the maturity level and audience of the initiative, and
may help inspire and empower citizens to use Open Data and maximize value to the public in practical ways. The strategy
is comprised of four stages: Early Engagement, Capacity Development, Use & Reuse and Further Development. 



## Stage 1: Early Engagement

During the early stage, engagement strategies typically focus on identifying the audience _??stakeholders??_ of either
data providers or consumers, and encouraging them to take the first critical steps towards an Open Data initiative. On
the provider side, engagement might mean identifying data managers in key government ministries and helping them
understand what data they already have. On the consumer side, engagement strategies might try to identify organizations
that have both the incentive and the means to use Open Data immediately. For both audiences, early stage engagement
often entails time spent explaining Open Data to those unfamiliar with the concept. The following events and programs
are examples of effective Stage 1 strategies:

* **"Open Data Sensitization" Workshops.** Designed for a variety of audiences, these events provide an overview of Open
Data best practices and benefits, along with insights from countries, regions and partners about their experiences.
Examples include the [Open Data Stakeholder Engagement
Workshop](http://commtech.gov.ng/index.php/videos/news-and-event/128-fg-kicksoff-opendata-initiative), which was held
during the January 2014 announcement of Nigeria's Open Data Initiative.

* **The "Business Case for Open Data" Roundtable.** This high-level
  roundtable encourages use, analysis and _(??ownership)_ of Open Data, and
  attempts to catalyze leadership on both supply and demand sides. Information provided at this roundtable
  resonates with particular audiences *[WHICH AUDIENCES?]* and is twinned with support
  opportunities from the Bank and its close partners, including the Data
  Literacy Bootcamp detailed in Stage 2. Examples include [Media
  Leaders Roundtables on 'Open Data and the Future of News'](http://allafrica.com/stories/201201300873.html) held in
  Ghana, Kenya, Nepal, Tanzania and South Africa.

* **Data Liberation Scrape-a-thon.** A two-day
  program that convenes international coders and sources local civic
  coders to collect existing, unstructured government data from
  current websites, re-structure them in machine-readable formats (CSV) and use them to populate a
  nascent or temporary Open Data platform. The program provides an opportunity to gain
  traction on the early Open Data process by capitalizing on what's already
  available, and leveraging it to build momentum toward further opening
  by individual ministries. One such program supports
  the [Hacks/Hackers Open News Scrape-a-thon in Chile](http://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersChile/photos/all_photos/?photoAlbumId=15810502), where
  "scraped" data is hosted for free on civically owned and communally
  managed repositories, such
  as [OpenAfricaData.org](http://africaopendata.org/) and [OpenDataLatinoAmerica.org](http://www.opendatalatinoamerica.org/home/).

 

## Stage 2: Capacity Development

For any data to be useful, consumers must have "data literacy:" They must know how to acquire and understand data, and
have the ability to apply them to specific challenges and needs. At this stage, engagement strategies should increase
data literacy and technical capacity among potential users, including journalists, non-profit organizations, academics
and software developers. The degree and style of technical training depends on the audience. Ideally, consumers would
take part in multiple training opportunities as their needs require, and connect to [local interest groups and
communities of practice](#LINK-further-development). The following courses and workshops typically address these
objectives:

* **Open Data Literacy Bootcamps.** These intensive three-day "learn-by-doing" workshops focus on core skills
development for journalists, civil society and civic coders. Each participant is assigned a desktop computer in a
classroom for hands-on, guided practicals. Sessions include demonstrations of Open Data portals; training on
Excel/spreadsheets and creating pivot tables; scraping local county and national data from local Open Data portals _WHY
WOULD YOU NEED TO SCRAPE AN OPEN DATA PORTAL?_; cleaning this data _WHY?_; creating visualizations; an introduction
to GIS mapping; and ultimately crafting narratives around data, including an introduction to building apps and action
plans using these skills and the data. Example engagements include Data Literacy Bootcamps
in [Bolivia](http://bolivia.databootcamp.org/), Ghana (National Budget Data),
[Ghana (Extractive Industries
Data)](http://ghana.databootcamp.org/), [Jordan](http://jordan.databootcamp.org/),
[Nepal](http://nepal.databootcamp.org/),
[Malawi](http://malawi.databootcamp.org/),
[Moldova](http://www.opendta.org/Pages/Events/Moldova-Innovation-Week-2012--Open-Development-Technology-Alliance.aspx),
[South Africa](https://sites.google.com/site/databootcampsa/),[Tanzania](https://sites.google.com/site/databootcamptz/)
and [Tunisia](https://sites.google.com/site/databootcamptunisia/).

* **Open Data Master Classes.** Five-day bootcamp-style
  training for mid-career demand-side practitioners, which dives even
  deeper into data literacy experiential learning and skills building
  with data analysis. _WHAT IS THE INTENDED AUDIENCE HERE?_

* **E-Learning on Open Data Literacy**. Currently under
  collaborative development for launch in 2013 _UPDATE?_, this weeks-long Open Data
  literacy e-learning course will 
  demo an even broader array of the previously discussed data literacy tools. It
  will be offered as both a facilitated and self-guided course, to
  maximize utility for a broad audience. The courses will be free, open
  source and made available on multiple e-learning platforms.
 

## Stage 3: Use & Reuse

At this stage, the objective is to harness Open Data in specific ways to address particular challenges and
opportunities, and use Open Data to generate tangible value and results. Governments may already have policy priorities
in which they are looking for solutions involving Open Data, and engagement at this stage can be designed to develop the
beginnings of those solutions. In other cases, the private sector may have its own ideas, and the goal may be to simply
encourage innovation towards any public purpose imaginable. The following events and engagements target specific
challenges and attempt to identify appropriate solutions:

* **'Utility' Hackathons.** Utility hackathons are organized
  around particular development challenges where data has already been
  surfaced, such as through data liberation scrape-a-thons. Technologists typically
  use existing data to develop and build utility apps that solve
  development problems, with an emphasis on public service delivery.
  Winners may receive seed grants to build out and deploy "utility
  apps," and may be offered post-hackathon mentoring and advice to
  accelerate development/deployment and -- more importantly -- 
  repurpose those utility apps in other country/regions to
  meet analogous needs. Examples of utility hackathons cut across key
  development areas, such as [domestic violence](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/01/22/domestic-violence-hackathon-smartphone-lifesaver), [water
  quality and access](http://www.scribd.com/doc/97458967/Water-Hackathon-Lessons-Learned) and [sanitation](http://www.sanitationhackathon.org/).

* **Apps Challenges and Competitions.** Competitions are similar to hackathons, but typically emphasize competitive elements with prizes and/or recognition awarded by a judging panel. The rules of the competition specify the products or applications considered eligible to meet the sponsor's goals. Examples include the [Open Data Challenge](http://opendatachallenge.org/), [Apps for Development](http://appsfordevelopment.challengepost.com), [Apps for Climate](http://data.worldbank.org/developers/app-competitions/apps-for-climate-winners) and the [Food Security Open Data Challenge](http://blog.usaid.gov/2012/05/food-security-open-data-challenge).

* **Prototype Funds.** A partnership-driven process to connect
  well-developed utility app and data usage projects (i.e.,
  those at the post-redesign/re-development stage, through prior mentorship and
  feedback) to "angel investor"-type funding to build out and deploy
  scalable models. An example of partnership-driven engagement is
  the [Africa News Innovation Challenge](http://africannewschallenge.org/).


## Stage 4: Further Development

Once the Open Data initiative is firmly established, engagement strategies focus on ensuring that the initiative remains
sustainable. This can mean reinforcing the efforts of earlier stages, propagating the initiative to other levels of
government (from national to sub-national or vice versa) and supporting data user communities both locally and
nationally. The following are examples of programs and other activities that advocate user sponsorship, fostering or
participation to help sustain initiatives:

* **Code for \[Your Country\].** This is a partnership-driven,
  six-month "Code Fellowship" program, which collaboratively integrates top
  civic coders into government ministries to deploy coding skills for
  improved public service delivery, and into media and civil society
  organizations to strengthen the creation of data-driven content,
  products and services for mass public consumption, analysis and use.
  This initiative also improves transparent, accountable
  governance by supporting the surfacing  _???_ and opening of demand-driven,
  actionable data and strengthening both data-driven analysis and
  decision-making at all levels. An example of partnership-driven
  engagement is [Code4Kenya](http://www.code4kenya.org/).

* **International and Regional Open Data Conferences.** These conferences are sponsored by different organizations and held around the world. They offer learning opportunities for both data providers and consumers and connect affiliated communities of practice. Examples include sessions at the first and second [International
  Open Government Data Conferences](http://www.data.gov/communities/conference), [Open Government Conference
  in Moscow](http://xn--e1aajfpcds8ay4h.xn--80abeamcuufxbhgound0h9cl.xn--p1ai/en/) and the [Regional Conference on Open Data for
  Latin America and the Caribbean](http://confdatosabiertos.uy/home).

* **Open Data Communities.** Organized user communities can provide sustained support and engagement over the long term.
They can be locally based or part of international consortia. Examples include [Hacks/Hackers](http://hackshackers.com),
the [Open Knowledge Network](https://okfn.org/network) and [Code for Africa](http://www.codeforafrica.org).
