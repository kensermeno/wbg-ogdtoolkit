#### Q. What is the difference between “Open Data” and “open source”?

A. Both Open Data and open source use the Internet to support collaborative development efforts and share data. The difference is that Open Data is a concept in which data are made available and free for everyone to use and re-use. For data to be open, they must also carry an understanding of how they are represented and exchanged (e.g., in the U.S., the data element for dates is MM/DD/YYYY; but in Europe, the convention is DD/MM/YYYY). Open source, however, is usually a reference to computer source code; it may also reference the actual design of the hardware, but this is rare. In addition, open source does not require standards or conventions as to how the data are represented.

#### Q. Is all publicly available data Open Data?

A. No. Some data that call themselves publicly available are available only to qualified or registered users, or in proprietary formats that can be paper based or difficult to manipulate. To be “open,” data must be accessible to anyone who is using basic software and technology.

#### Q. What are the minimum software and hardware/technical requirements to set up an Open Data platform?

A. *TBD*
