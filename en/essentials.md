title: Open Data Essentials
---

This section of the toolkit provides a summary of the essential elements
of open government data, starting with its definition and covering
issues from open data portals, applications that use open data, the
benefits of open data, open data policy declarations, learning resources
and technical assistance resources for open data. The toolkit provides
links to many examples of these.

Open Data Cookbook {#cookbook}
==================

*TODO: not yet convinced we need this section*

> This new, proposed section would give a “step-by-step” guide to building a government-wide Open Data program from the
> perspective of a senior government official. Every OGD program is very unique, so this will necessarily be very high
> level and abstract with links to other Toolkit sections and external resources filling in the gaps. Depending on length,
> this section could be moved elsewhere, such as within the “Open Data in a Nutshell” section.
