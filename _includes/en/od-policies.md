
Open Data policies serve two groups of users: Governments and other "supply-side" organizations, and
citizens and other data consumers. Each group gains distinct benefits and assistance from Open Data policies.
For governments, ministries and supply-side organizations, these policies provide guidance, instructions, requirements and tools
for implementing Open Data. Policies often spell out which types of data may **not** be considered open and why, and how
to safeguard sensitive information. They may also establish governance of the Open Data initiative, describe
inter-agency working groups and provide points of contact.

For the user group comprised of citizens, civil society organizations, businesses, researchers, and data consumers, Open Data policies clearly define which data
are or will be made public, how and where to acquire data, standards for providing data and metadata (which also
foster accountability), and how to engage with the government or producing agency. 

An additional benefit of Open Data policies is the insight they provide into a government's internal procedures for
managing the Open Data initiative, which helps consumers better understand the data ecosystem. Since governments are
often important consumers of their own data, Open Data policies can be helpful to governments from the standpoint of
both the consumer and producer.

## Guidance on Open Data Policies

* [8 Principles of Open Government Data](http://www.opengovdata.org/home/8principles). These principles were first
established by open government advocates in 2007. <cite>In short, they state that government data can be considered
open if they are made available in a form that is complete; primary; timely; accessible; machine processable;
non-discriminatory; non-proprietary; and license free.</cite>

* [UK Open Data White Paper: Unleashing the
Potential](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/CM8353_acc.pdf). Published in 2012, this paper
presents a detailed approach to the U.K.'s plan to unlock the potential of Open Data. <cite>The plan consists of three general
steps: enhancing access to and strengthening data usability; building trust in public data; and providing smarter, more
effective capabilities to use and share data. Objectives and potential outcomes of the plan include getting more data
into the public domain, and ensuring that data are accurate, shared responsibly and easy to use and obtain.</cite>

* [Australian Gov 2.0 Taskforce
Report](http://www.finance.gov.au/publications/gov20taskforcereport/doc/Government20TaskforceReport.pdf). This report,
published in 2009, presents Australia's plan to integrate Web 2.0 collaborative technologies, communities and tools into
government policy, service delivery and regulation issues. <cite> Called Government 2.0, this approach to governing helps
public agencies become more responsive, innovative and citizen-centric, as well as open and accountable. One of its
three central objectives is allowing open access to public sector information, and exploiting the full social and
economic value of this information as a national resource managed for public purposes.</cite>

* [Open Government Guide](http://www.rcfp.org/open-government-guide) (Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press).
This is a compendium of information on U.S. state laws that address the disclosure of open records and attendance at
open meetings. <cite>Organized into two parts (e.g., access to records and access to meetings), it details the rights of
reporters and other citizens to see information such as police records and voting results, and to attend official
meetings, including those of state and local governments. The Open Government Guide makes it easy to compare laws across
U.S. states and the District of Columbia.</cite> 

* [New Zealand's Journey to Open Data](http://www.slideshare.net/enotsluap/i2012-paul-stone-slides-not-seen). This
presentation, produced in 2012, provides guidance to New Zealand government agencies about releasing copyrighted and
non-copyrighted materials for re-use by third parties. <cite>In 2011, public service departments were directed by a
declaration to release high-value public data for re-use, in accordance with Open Data principles. High-value data are
those with economic and social, transparency and democratic, and/or efficiency outcomes.</cite> 

* [6 Steps to Open Data Success](http://www.socrata.com/blog/6-steps-to-open-data-success/) (Socrata). A summary of key
steps to building an effective Open Data program. <cite>These include: 1. Start with small, easy datasets; 2. Focus on promoting
transparency; 3. Ask the development community for insights on data usefulness and accessibility; 4. Increase internal
participation and get colleagues on board; 5. Optimize for efficiency and save time and money; and 6. Share and pool
data with neighboring cities, states and countries for additional benefits.</cite>

* [The Closed World of Company
Data](http://blog.opencorporates.com/2012/04/16/how-open-is-company-data-in-open-government-partnership-countries/).
This report published in April, 2012 by [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com)  examines the openness of companies
in [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) countries. <cite>OpenCorporates asserts that the world is
increasingly dominated by interconnected global companies, and that open access to key information, including core
datasets that affect our lives, is a fundamental principle of free markets and democracy. Many companies restrict access
to information, however, which impacts the ability of stakeholders, employees and society at large to understand and
influence companies and hold them accountable, and enables the potential for corporate corruption.</cite>

* [OECD: Open Government Data - Towards Empirical Analysis of Open
  Government Data Initiatives](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/open-government-data_5k46bj4f03s7-en). This paper
  explores the principles, concepts and criteria of open government data (OGD) initiatives and the challenges to their
  implementation at central and local levels of government. <cite>Authored by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development, the paper outlines a methodology to analyze the value of OGD initiatives, provides an analytical
  framework for the initiatives and recommends data to be collected across OECD countries. Applying the framework and
  collecting data could lead to the development of a common set of metrics with which to assess OGD impacts and value
  creation within and across countries.</cite>

* [Sunlight Foundation: Guidelines for Open Data Policies](http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/opendata/). These policy
guidelines include recommendations on what data should be made public, how to make it public and how to implement
policy. <cite>Topics addressed include guidance on what an Open Data policy can and should do when the objective is to create
a government data ecosystem where Open Data is the default. Setting a data default to "open" indicates that a government
is proactive about making public information available online and without barriers for reuse, and about making decisions
in the public interest.</cite> 

* [Briefing on Open Data Policy Declarations](../docs/briefing-on-open-data-declarations-generic.doc). A "policy declaration" is intended
to provide a clear signal of political intent on the part of a government in relation to an Open Data initiative. <cite>This
briefing provides background and considerations for the formulation of Open Data policy declarations.</cite>
