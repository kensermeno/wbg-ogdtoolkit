The term "Open Data" has a [very precise meaning](http://opendefinition.org). Data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse or redistribute it, subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.

There are two dimensions of data openness: 

1. The data must be **legally open,** which means they must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions. They must also be publicly available and accessible on a public server, without password or firewall restrictions. To make Open Data easier to find, most organizations create and manage [Open Data catalogs](essentials.html#examples).

2. The data must be **technically open,** which means they must be published in electronic formats that are [machine readable and preferably non-proprietary](http://opendatahandbook.org/en/appendices/file-formats.html),
so that anyone can access and use the data using common, freely available software tools.  

## Open Data Licenses ## {#licenses}

Organizations and governments use Open Data licenses to clearly explain the conditions under which their data may be used. Examples include:

* Standard, reusable licenses designed to provide consistent and broadly recognized terms of use; for instance, [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org), particularly
[CC-By](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) and [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),
as well as the [Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/). Associating data with CC0 is essentially the same as placing it in the public domain.

* Governments and international organizations that have developed their own licenses, such as the
[UK Open Government License](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/), [The World Bank Terms of Use](http://data.worldbank.org/summary-terms-of-use), and the
[French Government License Ouverte](http://www.scribd.com/doc/69411439/French-PSI-Re-Use-Licence-Licence-Ouverte-Open-Licence-ENG).
