
As with any public initiative, Open Data involves some expenditure of public resources and effort. As such, public
officials are often interested in the benefits of Open Data compared to the levels of required effort.

Similar to other global commodities, data has significant potential to provide benefits. In fact, data has been [referred to as the new
oil](http://www.forbes.com/sites/perryrotella/2012/04/02/is-data-the-new-oil), because while both data and oil have intrinsic value, they both must be "refined" or otherwise transformed to realize their full potential. When government
data are made accessible and reusable, they enable individuals, organizations and even governments themselves to
innovate and collaborate in new ways.

Broadly speaking, the benefits of Open Data include:


* **Transparency.** Open Data supports public oversight of governments and helps reduce corruption by enabling greater
  transparency. For instance, Open Data makes it easier to monitor government activities, such as tracking public budget
  expenditures and impacts. It also encourages greater citizen participation in government affairs and supports democratic
  societies by providing information about voting procedures, locations and ballot issues.

* **Public Service Improvement.** Open Data gives citizens the raw materials they need to engage their governments and
  contribute to the improvement of public services. For instance, citizens can use Open Data to contribute to public
  planning, or provide feedback to government ministries on service quality.

* **Innovation.** Public data, and their re-use, are key resources for social innovation and economic growth. Open Data
  provides ways for governments to collaborate with citizens and evaluate public services by giving citizens access to
  data about those services. Businesses and entrepreneurs are using Open Data to better understand potential markets and
  build new data-driven products.

* **Efficiency.** Open Data makes it easier for government ministries to discover and access their own data or data from
  other ministries, which reduces acquisition costs, redundancy and overhead. Open Data can also empower citizens with the
  ability to alert governments to gaps in public datasets and to provide more accurate information.

## Key Research on Open Data Benefits ##

  information](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/open_data_unlocking_innovation_and_performance_with_liquid_information?cid=other-eml-alt-mgi-mck-oth-2910/)

  value annually across seven sectors in the United States alone.

* [Exploring the emerging impacts of open data in developing countries](http://opendataresearch.org/emergingimpacts).
  This is a multi-country, multi-year study led by the World Wide Web Foundation to understand how Open Data is being put
  to use in different countries and contexts across the developing world.

  (Open Economics Working Group, OKF). This group advocates for economics to be built on transparent foundations and for
  economic data and analysis to be made available to all of society, not just economists. <cite>It interprets economic research
  on Open Data and identifies best practices and legal, regulatory and technical standards for open economic data. Its
  blog features positive effects that opening data has had in economics and shows how economists can mainstream the
  openness concept.</cite>

  (Open Knowledge Foundation). This presentation provides examples to support opening government data, and cites key benefits
  that occur when governments open data, i.e., it helps drive the creation of innovative businesses and services that
  deliver social and commercial value, and encourages government transparency and citizen engagement.

  (Advisory Panel on Public Sector Information). In addition to embracing government initiatives on opening public
  datasets, this paper argues for implementing a strategic infrastructure, called the National Information Framework
  (NIF). <cite>The framework would leverage the value of Open Data, generate social and economic benefits and help transform data use to
  improve personal, government and corporate decision-making and support growth. The NIF approach includes Open Data
  policies, standards, metadata and more, and would potentially include information derived from the private sector and
  entire public sector.</cite>

  (Stephan Shakespeare). Based on a commissioned market assessment of public sector information (PSI) and public
  opinion surveys, this review assesses the economic and social value of PSI in the UK. It evaluates the size, reach and
  nature of the market for PSI, the information of greatest interest to citizens and how they use it, and citizens'
  policy preferences. It also addresses PSI privacy, capability, evidence and ownership.

  Department for Business Innovation & Skills, is the first UK-wide market assessment of PSI. It establishes an evidence
  base regarding the value of PSI and highlights policy implications from a study of how it could be better utilized. <cite>It
  discusses how PSI is used inside and outside of government and identifies barriers, such as competitiveness, funding and
  regulation, to fully exploiting its value.</cite>

  after heart surgery success rates were published, and survival rates improved by 50%.

  financial benefits from the Danish agreement, and the most recent data showed that the private sector reaped the
  greatest benefits. Not all expected benefits of the agreement, however, had been realized when the study was
  published.</cite>

  To understand the barriers that governments, organizations and institutions face when opening data, the Sunlight
  Foundation used crowdsourcing to collect 50+ commonly cited reasons for not releasing data, from sources both inside
  and outside of government. <cite>The responses illuminated a variety of concerns, including the potential for other people
  altering the released data and the negative PR that could result from the data. Crowdsourcing was used again to learn how
  others responded to those concerns, and the answers were published in a 10-part blog series, #WhyOpenData.</cite>

  that knowledge could be used to benefit the economy and society as a whole. <cite>Concerns with the clarification of Open

  This report cites three potential solutions in which the release and reuse of Open Data could help curb government
  corruption and bureaucracy: By identifying the different types of corruption in various sectors; by suggesting
  relevant data that should be released in a particular context; and by demonstrating best practices of information and
  data reuse to provide transparency in these sectors.
