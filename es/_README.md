# Multilingual implementation #

Multi-lingual implementation is pretty bare-bones. There must be a corresponding translated file for each .md file in the "en/"
directory. Simply copy that directory and translate the files. Also, extend and translate the language-specific elements of
the defaults and lang variables as necessary in _config.yml.

"This page in" links are disabled by default but can easily be enabled in _layouts/default.html

Note there is currently no rtl implementation for Arabic


## Multilingual TO-DO ##

* Translate the platform diagrams (PNGs) on technology pages

* Review spurrious h2/h3 identifiers (done for French)

* Most "more..." links (i.e. the <cite/> tags) were removed in translations. Text is okay but tags need to be added back. I think
  this is only for French

* Review pullquotes in spanish: Miguel didn't do those
* Review "more..." text in spanish: Miguel didn't review
