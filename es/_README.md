# Multilingual implementation #

Multi-lingual implementation is pretty bare-bones. There must be a corresponding translated file for each .md file in the "en/"
directory. Simply copy that directory and translate the files. Also, extend and translate the language-specific elements of
the defaults and lang variables as necessary in _config.yml.

"This page in" links are disabled by default but can easily be enabled in _layouts/default.html

Note there is currently no rtl implementation for Arabic
