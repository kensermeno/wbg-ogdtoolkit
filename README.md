This is the project for the World Bank's Open Government Data Toolkit.

The site was designed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
and is primarily written in [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/),
an increasingly popular Markdown variant. Kramdown makes HTML authoring
easy by providing substitutes for the most common markup tags and structures
(paragraphs, headers, lists, bullets, links, tables, footnotes, etc).

The toolkit is designed to run on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
but can easily run on just about any server running Apache (or another web
server), Jekyll (which requires [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
and [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/)), and git.
